# About

Idle Intelligence is an independent research lab founded on the premise that meaningful work in artificial intelligence does not require a campus, a cluster, or a Series A.

We operate at the intersection of language computing, distributed systems, and a persistent unwillingness to sleep at reasonable hours. Our research is conducted on hardware that would embarrass most benchmarking papers, and we consider this a feature rather than a limitation.

## What We Do

We build tools and publish findings in three areas:

- **Language as computation** — exploring the boundary between generating text and executing programs, and what happens when you stop treating that as a boundary.
- **Inference at the edge** — making models run in places they were not designed to run, on budgets they were not designed to respect.
- **Collective model behavior** — studying the properties that emerge when small models are composed, networked, and left unsupervised.

## Principles

We believe that compute constraints produce better research questions. We believe that open publication is non-negotiable. We believe that if your methodology section requires a funding disclosure longer than your abstract, something has gone sideways.

We do not have a manifesto. This is close enough.
