**Language Computing** — Treating natural language as a runtime environment rather than a dataset. We study what happens when text becomes executable and execution becomes conversational.

**Distributed Inference** — Running models where no one expects them. Commodity hardware, edge devices, browser tabs left open overnight. If it has a CPU, it has potential.

**Networked Cognition** — What emerges when many small models talk to each other instead of one large model talking to itself. We don't know yet. That's the point.
